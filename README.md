Raseroka's Calculator
Welcome to Raseroka's Calculator – a simple, colorful, and interactive calculator built in Python. It supports four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and features vibrant colors to enhance user interaction.

Features
* Addition: Adds two numbers.
* Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
* Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
* Division: Divides the first number by the second (includes error handling for division by zero).
* Colorful Output: The results and prompts are displayed in different colors using the colorama module.
* Continual Usage: After each calculation, the program asks if you want to continue or exit.
